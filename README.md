I have developed a strong inclination to delve deeper into the field of Machine Learning (ML). It is worth noting that ML, while closely related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
is not interchangeable with it. ML serves as an integral component of AI, encompassing a wide array of algorithms and techniques that empower systems to learn and improve autonomously 
from data without explicit programming. By leveraging statistical methods and data mining, ML enables the creation of predictive models that can forecast and anticipate future outcomes 
based on historical and existing data. The application of predictive modeling facilitates the extraction of valuable insights from intricate datasets, 
thereby supporting informed decision-making and conferring a competitive advantage across various industries. Through the utilization of ML algorithms, organizations can uncover hidden patterns, 
relationships, and trends within their data.

The objective is to develop accurate algorithms for estimating stock volatility, aiming to generate meaningful predictions. Building upon prior iterations, which achieved an accuracy level of approximately 60%.
